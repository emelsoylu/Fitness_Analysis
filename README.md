#train.py
This Python script performs comprehensive machine learning model training and evaluation for a human activity recognition task using pose estimation data. The code loads a dataset (from 'Dataset.csv') containing body landmark features and corresponding activity labels, then systematically trains and evaluates nine different classification models (including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and various boosting algorithms) with standardized preprocessing. Each model pipeline incorporates feature scaling and the respective classifier, with performance measured using accuracy scores on a 30% test set. The script outputs training progress and accuracy results for each algorithm before saving all trained models as pickle files with .h5 extensions for later use in activity prediction. This automated workflow allows for quick comparison of multiple classifiers' performance on the same dataset while ensuring consistent preprocessing, making it particularly useful for selecting the best-performing model for deployment in video-based activity recognition systems.

# predict_class.py
This console-based video activity recognition system analyzes human movements in video files to identify specific activities. Using MediaPipe's advanced pose estimation technology, the program extracts body landmark coordinates from 10 evenly sampled frames of the input video. These spatial features are then processed by a pre-trained KNN classifier (loaded from 'knn_model.h5') which predicts the most likely activity. The system accepts common video formats (MP4, AVI, MOV) through simple command-line prompts, validates the input file, and displays the final prediction after processing. Designed for ease of use, it handles the entire workflow from video input to activity classification without requiring complex setup, making it suitable for basic human activity recognition tasks in offline environments. The implementation focuses on core functionality while maintaining clear error messages and user guidance throughout the console interface.
