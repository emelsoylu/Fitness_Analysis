# Dataset Description 
We constructed a video-based human activity dataset comprising six distinct types of exercises. For each exercise type, 100 individual videos were collected, totaling 600 video samples. Pose detection was applied to each video using a landmark-based approach (e.g., MediaPipe Pose), extracting 33 body landmarks per frame. For every frame, the data consists of a class label in the first column, followed by the x, y, z, and visibility values of each of the 33 landmarks, resulting in a total of 132 features per row (1 class label + 33 landmarks Ã— 4 values).

Each video was processed individually and saved as a separate CSV file, where each row corresponds to a single video frame. The dataset was partitioned such that 90 videos per class (540 videos in total) were allocated to the training set, and 10 videos per class ( 60 videos) were reserved for the test set. During training, all CSV files in the training folder were concatenated into a single dataset to be used for model training.

# train.py
This Python script performs comprehensive machine learning model training and evaluation for a human activity recognition task using pose estimation data. The code loads a dataset (from 'Dataset.csv') containing body landmark features and corresponding activity labels, then systematically trains and evaluates nine different classification models (including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and various boosting algorithms) with standardized preprocessing. Each model pipeline incorporates feature scaling and the respective classifier, with performance measured using accuracy scores on a 30% test set. The script outputs training progress and accuracy results for each algorithm before saving all trained models as pickle files with .h5 extensions for later use in activity prediction. This automated workflow allows for quick comparison of multiple classifiers' performance on the same dataset while ensuring consistent preprocessing, making it particularly useful for selecting the best-performing model for deployment in video-based activity recognition systems.

# predict_class.py
This console-based video activity recognition system analyzes human movements in video files to identify specific activities. Using MediaPipe's advanced pose estimation technology, the program extracts body landmark coordinates from 10 evenly sampled frames of the input video. These spatial features are then processed by a pre-trained KNN classifier (loaded from 'knn_model.h5') which predicts the most likely activity. The system accepts common video formats (MP4, AVI, MOV) through simple command-line prompts, validates the input file, and displays the final prediction after processing. Designed for ease of use, it handles the entire workflow from video input to activity classification without requiring complex setup, making it suitable for basic human activity recognition tasks in offline environments. The implementation focuses on core functionality while maintaining clear error messages and user guidance throughout the console interface.

# fitness_app.py
This Python application is a comprehensive fitness analysis tool that combines computer vision, machine learning, and GUI development to automatically analyze workout videos and calculate calorie burn. The system uses MediaPipe for pose detection and landmark extraction, employing a pre-trained KNN model to classify different exercise types (jumping, pull-ups, cycling, push-ups, squats, running) from video input. The core functionality revolves around tracking joint angles throughout the exercise duration, counting movement repetitions using peak detection algorithms, and calculating calories burned based on MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) values that vary according to exercise intensity and type. The application features a user-friendly Tkinter GUI that allows users to input their weight, upload exercise videos, preview them with playback controls, and receive detailed analysis results including activity classification, repetition counts, exercise intensity ratings, and personalized calorie burn calculations. The system automatically saves results to a CSV file for progress tracking and provides comprehensive feedback with performance metrics and workout recommendations, making it a complete solution for fitness enthusiasts who want to monitor and analyze their exercise routines using AI-powered video analysis.
